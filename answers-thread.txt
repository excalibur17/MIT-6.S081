What the insert method does is that it first creates a new entry pointing to the head of the corresponding entry list and then set the head to the new entry. It turns out that there may be multiple thread creating entries at the same time, when running in multi-core environment, and operating on the same entry list, resulting a race condition. Consequently, some entries may get lost if that entry is not set to the new head and never could be found in that entry list.
